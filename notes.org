There's some initialization order shit going on. Best to nip that in the bud.

Better design for info buffers: Keep a pointer to the info buffer in the parent,
but that's just a pointer to somewhere in the linked list. That way, you can
treat it like any other buffer when you render and such, but when the parent
changes it can update the child.

Ah, C. Your simplicity is your elegance and your grotesqueness. Working with
pointers /fucking sucks/ sometimes. Manually writing the equivalent of copy
constructors is a pain in the ass. Stretchy buffers are amazing because they
give you the elegance of using pointers for everything -- but as far as
documenting their own purpose, they fucking suck. Looks like a pointer, walks
like a pointer. Not using stretchy buffers fucking sucks because most of the
time you want a pointer, god damn it.
